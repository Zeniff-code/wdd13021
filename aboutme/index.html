    <h2> " Zeniff "</h2> 
    
    <p> My name is Zeniff 
I would like to complete a degree in applied technology.
I like to play the piano, practice sports, watch movies and play video games.
I work in a company that sells automotive parts, I would like to learn more about web page design and technology because I have always liked computers.
In high school I had the opportunity to study computer science but after that I couldn't study a degree in computer science and I really like it a lot.
I have been a member of the church since I was born, I served the mission in Tabasco, Mexico.</p>
<p>What I like most about BYU is the environment of respect and trust for learning that teachers and students transmit, and that all learning is based within the norms of the church.
  
      </p>
      <p>For me it is a huge opportunity to be able to study online and I believe that the Lord wishes that we can learn everything we can to be self-reliant and serve others in his work.
I am happy to take this course, I hope to learn a lot and have the pleasure of meeting and learning from all of you.</p>
